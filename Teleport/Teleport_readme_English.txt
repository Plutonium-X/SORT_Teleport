INSTALLATION: 

If you have installed previous version of this mod, uninstall it at first and delete Teleport directory and files Setup-Teleport.exe and Setup-Teleport.tp2.
Otherwise extract RAR in game directory and run Setup-Teleport.exe.

CONTENTS:

1) Teleport spell for SoA 

This part of mod adds a 7th level spell to the game, that allows the entire party teleport to the areas you´ve already visited. You can´t teleport to all previous places, just some of the most important areas are picked up. Furthermore, you can´t teleport form some other areas as well. You can buy scroll with this spell in Adventurer´s Mart (..lady Yuth have it...) and in Ust Natha.

This part of mod is intended for SoA only, and allows you to teleport between areas from original game BGII-SoA.

2) Teleport spell for ToB 

Same as first part of this mod, this part adds a 7th level spell to the game, that allows the entire party teleport to the areas you´ve already visited. You can´t teleport to all previous places, just some of the most important areas are picked up. Furthermore, you can´t teleport form some other areas as well. You can buy scroll with this spell at Pen and Parchment (Lazarus).

This part of mod is intended for ToB only, and can be installed without first part of this mod; this part allows you to teleport between areas from datadisk BGII-ToB.

	* If you have both previous parts of this mod installed, you can teleport back from ToB to some SoA areas, but you 		can move only in this area. It means you can´t leave it by traditional way (....via normal exits...)

3) Modification of NPC`s and stronghold quests, so they can take place in chapter 4., 5. and 7., when you teleport e.g. from Brynlaw back to Athkatla.
